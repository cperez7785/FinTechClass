## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
When Trov first started it wanted the solve the current insurance process where you called in and dealt with a sales representative. The going back and forth and the timeline for getting insured.  Scott wanted to make it simple to get insurance and get it instantly. Since 2019 Trevo has shifted its direct-to-consumer business model to business to business model. To focus on helping companies embed insurance products that meet the needs of their customers on their mobile apps or website.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

When Trov first launches their intended customer base were millennials who had expensive items such as cameras, camera equipment, bicycle, etc. This was huge when they started because normal insurance companies only covered this item through a home insurance policy or a renters policy. Items such as Cameras or expensive road bicycles also need to be Schedule to be able to be covered under this policies. And there was also be a high deductible to be able to claim the loss of individual products. In some cases, a claim will have the insurer lose their discounts or be non-renewed. That shift has changed since they ended their direct-to-consumer model in 2019. Now they are focusing on companies that will like to easily embed insurance products within other digital experiences.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stack share to find this information.)
Trov is using API - Application Programming Interface policies.  This will allowed two applications to be able to talk to each other.
